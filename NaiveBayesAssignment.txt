Naive Bayes OOP Assignment

Classes:
	Control:
	-Simple driver code, as most functionality is containe din other classes
	-Initialises InputScan and gui classes, with some optional debug

	InputScan:
	-Class which reads the csv, analyses the data, and factorises it for use in Naive Bayes
	-Spans multiple methods, couldn't find a good point to split it further before Naive Bayes
	-Needed to be referenced in other classes, namely Bayes and GUI
	-Does most of the legwork for factoring and 'sorting' data
	-Majority of work done in initialisation but can be accessed through methods later
	
	Bayes:
	-Calculates likelihood of instances being entrepreneur or not, using a dataset from InputScan
	-Mostly used by GUI for testing instances, but is used to test built data
	-Has methods that feed into the main 'judging' method

	GUI:
	-Initialises JFrame, adding several components making up the UI
	-Holds function for assessing whether student becomes entrepreneur, passing info to Bayes
	-Displays factors/percentages in dataset, and the overall accuracy from the InputScan

Core Functionality Implemented:
	-Reading of csv
	-Categorising data into respective areas
	-Reservation of data to be used as a test of accuracy for dataset
	-Factors developed, for all students, and for either case
	-Percentages created from said factors, to be used in Naive Bayes
	-Classifier is defined using percentages, utilised on request from gui
	-GUI to implement instance input
	  -Dropboxes to minimise input error
	  -Button to take input and enter into Bayes calculations
	  -Compares prob if entrepreneur or not, then tells you the most likely outcome
	  -Adds instance to overall dataset, refactoring the relevant factors/percentages

Optional features:
	-Accuracy of dataset, calculated as part of core functions, is displayed for users
	-Overall factors/ percentages are on display, with tabbed panes allow for switching between the two

Wishful Thinking:
	-I hadn't fully understood Layout managers in Swing, so a better gui could have been possible
	-With a better gui, I would have added *fun facts*, randomly generating fun facts based on factors,
	ie, "Female Student are more elikely to become netrepreneurs"
	-Due to the way I coded the building/ testing of the dataset, I couldn't implement a way of improving the 		dataset through the building.
	-Maybe a debug feature to reveal the probabilities when checking an instance
